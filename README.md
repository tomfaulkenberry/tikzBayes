# tikzBayes

This repo provides an example of how to draw graphical Bayesian models using Tikz.  It provides nothing new over https://github.com/jluttine/tikz-bayesnet, other than the fact that my examples is more closely related to my research.  In fact, the model depicted in example.pdf is directly derived from Matzke and Wagenmakers (2009).

Instructions:
1. make sure the file ~tikzlibrarybayesnet.code.tex~ is contained in the latex search path (easiest way to do this is to keep it in the directory of your .tex file.

2. include the command ~\usetikzlibrary{bayesnet}~ in your preamble.
